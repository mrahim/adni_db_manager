Has gotten lost in semi-familar areas (going to tax accountant, where she goes once a year), difficulty recently gathering tax records but was able to do it. Got check book out of balance & needed help from proxy. Apparently over spent, giving money/writing checks to junk mail advertisers/organizations. Forgot to go to New Years event that she has been going to every year x 30 years. Reports she was diagnosed dx'd with AD by neurologist. Reports no decline in shopping, cooking, housekeeping, hobbies (playing cards, reading). Will classify as late MCI. Still lives independently with regular help from family or friends.

My assessment is that he is not depressed.  This patient has been in prior studies with our group and he has really not shown signs of depressed mood in the past either.  He does have a sense of awareness of his deficits and rightly appraises the gravity of his illness on the GDS.  In prior studies with our group he has amyloid imaging (when he was MCI) and is strongly amyloid positive.
